  Quota check after upload; failure check.
  Upload CSV metadata (6)

  Owner/user ID of asset upload in prefs?
  Opschonen van asset/collectie etc wle stuff. (wle maakt lege assets)
  
  Quota is calculated on user ID, so changing the user ID will result in reset

  But stills are generated with the user_id and not with group? and 
  transcodings?
  
  Meerdere stills op detail page.
